      <p>This website was developed to help my fellow chemistry graduates to study on their licensure examination online. In addition, we plan to add more features
	  by adding other scientific fields as we collect lots of questions. Those fields may include biology, physics, earth sciences, and more. Web encoding and concepts was
	  done by a biologocial engineering and chemistry graduate.</p>

      <h2>Science Tutorial for College Level</h2>
      <p>A website that offers a lot of questions or problems commonly encountered by students during their studies on sciences such as biology, chemistry, and physics.
      You can have access to tons of questions and basic lectures to simply understand concepts in a specific scientific field. Through this, students are encouraged to learn more with the aid of our
      online services. If you don't see your questions you're looking for, you can ask on us through our email.	</p>
      <div class=><img src="philosophy.jpg"/></div>
      <p>Biology section includes different studies such as fundamentals of genetics, cell biology, microbiology, gene biotechnology, physiology,immunology, tissue engineering,and biochemistry. For the chemistry
	  section, it consists of general chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, and organic chemistry. For physics section, higher mathematics such as calculus, linear kinematics, rotational
      kinematics, thermodynamics fundamentals, waves, acoustics, optics, and electromagnetism. We ensure that the following questions and lectures are outsourced to reliable references.
      For further questions or donations for the improvement of the website, you can <a href="mailto:bryan.angelocastillo.10@gmail.com">e-mail us here</a>.</p>
